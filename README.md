Developed a real-time motorcycle tracking system using an ESP32 microcontroller, GPS Neo-6M, and MPU6050 accelerometer. The system collects location and motion data and transmits it via UDP and Bluetooth to a custom Android application. The mobile app displays real-time tracking on Google Maps and sends alerts in case of abnormal movements, such as a potential vehicle fall.
